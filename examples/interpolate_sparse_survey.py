-------------------------------------

Sometimes a survey will only have a few points and when it's plotted it
looks weird and angular because these points are connected together with
straight lines.

Here's an example of how to use the `interpolate_survey` function in the
`connector` module to calculate extra points along the minimum curvature
path between the survey stations.

This is also an alternative quick method for creating a well path.
